    <para>
        The Adapter object is the most important sub-component of Zend\Db.
        It is responsible for adapting any code written in or for Zend\Db
        to the targeted php extensions and vendor databases.  In doing this,
        it creates an abstraction layer for the PHP extensions, which is called
        the "Driver" portion of the Zend\Db adapter.  It also creates a lightweight
        abstraction layer for the various idiosyncrasies that each vendor specific
        platform might have in it's SQL/RDBMS implementation which is called the
        "Platform" portion of the adapter.

        <para>
            Creating an adapter can simply be done by instantiating the
            Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter class.  The most common use case, while not the
            most explicit, is to pass an array of information to the Adapter.

            * other names will work as well.  Effectively, if the PHP manual
            uses a particular naming, this naming will be supported by our Driver.
            For example, dbname in most cases will also work for 'database'.  Another
            example is that in the case of Sqlsrv, UID will work in place of username.
            Which format you chose is up to you, but the above table represents the
            offical abstraction names.

        <para>
            It is important to know that by using this style of adapter creation, the Adapter
            will attempt to create any dependencies that were not explicitly provided.  A Driver
            object will be created from the contents of the $driver array provided in the
            constructor. A Platform object will be created based off the type of Driver object
            that was instantiated.  And lastly, a default ResultSet object is created and utilized.
            Any of these objects can be injected, to do this, see the next section.

        <para>
            The more expressive and explicit way of creating an adapter is by injecting all your
            dependencies up front.  Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter uses constructor injection, and all
            required dependencies are injected through the constructor, which has the following
            signature (in pseudo-code):

        <para>
            $driver - an array or an instance of Zend\Db\Adapter\Driver\DriverInterface
            $platform - (optional) an instance of Zend\Db\Platform\PlatformInterface, the default will be created based off the driver implementation
            $queryResultSetPrototype - (optional) an instance of Zend\Db\ResultSet\ResultSet, to understand this object's role, see the section below on querying through the adapter

        <para>
            By default, query() prefers that you use "preparation" as a means for processing SQL
            statements.  This generally means that you will supply a SQL statement with the values
            substituted by placeholders, and then the parameters for those placeholders are
            supplied separately.  An example of this workflow with Zend\Db\Adapter\Adapter is:

    $adapter->query('SELECT * FROM `artist` WHERE `id` = ?', array(5));

        <para>
            In some cases, you have to execute statements directly.  The primary purpose for
            needing to execute sql instead of prepare and execute a sql statement, might be
            because you are attempting to execute a DDL statement (which in most extensions
            and vendor platforms), are un-preparable.  An example of executing:
        </para>


            <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
            $adapter->query('ALTER TABLE ADD INDEX(`foo_index`) ON (`foo_column`))', Adapter::QUERY_MODE_EXECUTE);
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The primary difference to notice is that you must provide the Adapter::QUERY_MODE_EXECUTE
            (execute) as the second parameter.
        </para>

    <section xml:id="zend.db.adapter.statement-creation"><info><title>Creating Statements</title></info>

        <para>
            While query() is highly useful for one-off and quick querying of a
            database through Adapter, it generally makes more sense to create a
            statement and interact with it directly, so that you have greater control
            over the prepare-then-execute workflow.  To do this, Adapter gives you a
            routine called createStatement() that allows you to create a Driver
            specific Statement to use so you can manage your own prepare-then-execute workflow.
        </para>

            <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[

        <para>
            The Platform object provides an API to assist in crafting queries in a way that
            is specific to the SQL implemetation of a particular vendor.  Nuances such
            as how identifiers or values are quoted, or what the identifier separator
            character is are handled by this object.  To get an idea of the capabilities,
            the interface for a platform object looks like this:
        </para>

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
        interface Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\PlatformInterface
        {

        }

            Generally speaking, it is easier to get the proper Platform instance from the adapter:

        <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[

            The ParameterContainer object is a container for the various parameters that
            need to be passed into a Statement object to fulfill all the various
